Explanations to the the log entries.

Debug help:
L1, L2 and L3 are the positions of logging calls in pgart_control_heating.py.

Scheduled processing to set the desired indoor temperature:
100000 New_schema. The system acts on a scheduled change in set_indoor_temp_hours = 05_17, 06_20, 20_15.
000000 No_schema. There is not any scheduled change for this hour.
000001 Set_manually. The desired temperature has been set manually in between two runs.

Hourly-rate processing:
000100 set_hour. The desired indoor temperature is decreased by hr_rate:2.
010000 (re)set_hour. The desired indoor temperature is increased back to normal temperature by hr_rate:2.

Windchill processing:
000010 set_hour. The desired indoor temperature is increased by windchill:1.
001000 (re)reset_hour. The desired indoor temperature is decreased back to normal temperature by windchill:1.

out:2       is the temperature read from the outdoor sensor of the pump.
room:200    is the temperature read from the room sensor of the pump. If a room sensor is not installed the value is 200.
sensor:20.2 is the temperature read from a raspberry with a room temperature sensor.
pump:21     is the "heatingEffect" (the desired indoor temperature) read from the pump.
new:21      is the new desired indoor temperature to be set by the program.

hr_rate:2   is the number of degrees adjustment of the desired temperature caused by hourly-rates.
windshill:1 is the number of degrees adjustment of the desired temperature caused by the windchill effect.

For both hr_rate and windshill:
off         No adjustment this hour.
set_hour    + or - adjustment of the desired temperature this hour.
reset_hour  reset the adjustment of the desired temperature this hour.
